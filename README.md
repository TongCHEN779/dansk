Guide to Tong's Danish Learning Website
---

This website contains all my Danish notes and materials during my study at [Studieskolen](https://www.studieskolen.dk/). Feel free to use, share, and comment on anything about Danish!

The website contains a homepage, 5 main blocks and a word search engine:

- Homepage: Danish (former) queen Margrethes' new year talk 2023.

- Block 1: "Ordforråd og Grammatik". Danish vocabulary and grammar.

- Block 2: "Undervisning". Learning materials from various museums, collections, and modules for DU3.

- Block 3: "Lytte". Audio and vedio materials from various podcasts and websites.

- Block 4: "Læsning". Contexts and books from various museums, collections and exhibitions.

- Block 5: "Links". Useful links about Danish learning, dictionary, news, culture, history, great people, etc.

- Search engine: Word search engine for all subpages in block 1 (except "Pronominer").

(**Easter eggs**: Do you know who is the man in the portrait? Can you find another information about him somewhere in the website?)
